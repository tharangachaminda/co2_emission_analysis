Carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions play a pivotal role in shaping the global climate and environmental landscape. As one of the primary greenhouse gases, CO₂ contributes significantly to the ongoing issue of climate change. These emissions result from various human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas for energy production, transportation, industrial processes, and deforestation.

In this project I will be analysing how 
- different countries, 
- different geographical regions, 
- different econimies in the world 

contribute to the emission of carbon dioxide.

### Data Sources
I will be using CO2 emission data set by country from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/co2-emissions-by-country).

### Technologies and Tools
1. Pandas library
2. Numpy library
3. Folium - interactive map library
4. Plotly-dash for dashboarding
5. Tablue public for dashboarding
